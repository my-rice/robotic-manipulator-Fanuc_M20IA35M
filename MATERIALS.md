## Git
This repository is version-controlled using Git. Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase. More information on Git can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/doc).

## Paradigm: Object-Oriented Programming and Design Patterns
Most of the code in this repository follows the object-oriented paradigm, and it is written in C++. Quality software often benefits from design patterns, which are useful constructs for solving common software design problems. 

## Scrum
The code development follows an incremental approach, making agile methodologies a suitable fit. The Scrum framework is used to manage the development process. More information on Scrum can be found [here](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum).
